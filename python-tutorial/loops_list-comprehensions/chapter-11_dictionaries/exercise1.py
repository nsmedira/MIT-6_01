# Exercise 11.1
# Think Python
# Chapter 11 - Dictionaries
# Exercise 1

# Write a function that reads the words in words.txt and stores them as keys in a dictionary. It doesnâ€™t matter what the values are. Then you can use the in operator as a fast way to check whether a string is in the dictionary.

# If you did Exercise 10.8, you can compare the speed of this implementation with the list in operator and the bisection search.

In Python, indentation indicates grouping and line breaks indicate statement termination.

Python doesn't use semi-colons

Colons are used to start an indented block, so they appear on the first line of a procedure definition, when starting a `while` or `for` loop, and after the condition in an `if`, `elif`, or `else`.

In Python, there are no variable declarations and the same variable can be used at different points in your program to hold data objects of different types.

A module in Python is a separate file containing procedures grouped together according to what they do.

To use a module in another file, it needs to be imported. For example, for module file `utility.py`:

`import utility`

If there is a procedure in `utility.py` called `foo`, it can be called using `utility.foo`

# Complex numbers

Python has a primitive for complex numbers. Use  `complex(real, imag)` to create a complex number.

`complex(1, 2) == 1 + 2j`

In math, we would be used to `i` as the imaginary number but in Python is it `j` to avoid confusion with `i` in electric engineering which stands for current.
